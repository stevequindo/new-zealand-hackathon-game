# New Zealand Hacakaton 
The game that got me first place in the NZ hackathon.

It was built for UNICEF: Youth for change. 
The challenge was to build anything that spreads what unicef believes in.

# Idea behind the game (my 2017 draft)
-	The whole idea behind this simple game is what UNICEF believes in
-	I have made this belief into the form of a game, making it a visual and interactive representation of it

		**Advertises the message of what they believe in**
-	You must survive and fulfil your potential in order to make it to the end - a better world (conveyed through the background changing over time)
-	This in itself is a visual and creative way of portraying what the children, unicef helps, is fighting in their day to day lives

## Enemies
- The enemies in the game are **Amoeba** - cell organisms that causes harm to those children Unicef fights for.
- The **multiplying** effect of the enemies comes from the fact that this disease in contagious.
- Educates the player playing the game.
- Playing the game you will realise that they aim for the characters feet - this comes from the fact
that in the structure of Amoeba they move by using their "false feet".

## Background
- Four backgrounds used which is found in the _background_ folder.
- The setting of the background goes dark to gloomy to a bright sunny sunrise as levels progress.
